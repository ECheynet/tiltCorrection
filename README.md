## Summary

The present submission includes some algorithm to correct tilt angle errors from sonic anemometers, including the method by Wilczak et al. [1]. Other methods are the double and triple rotation algorithm.

## Content

The present submission contains :

- 4 example files: one for the planar fit algorithm, one for the double rotation, one for the triple rotation and one for the estimation of the friction velocity with the different retrieval algorithms.
- The function tiltCorrection.m 

- The function friction_velocity.m

- the file data.mat that includes simulated wind data


Any comment, question or suggestion to improve the algorithm is warmly welcomed.
